            <p>
                I am a former Mechanical Engineer going through a career change. I want to become a Software Developer now, specifically
                a Front-end Developer. I love design; when I initially was introduced to HTML and CSS, I was not impressed--in fact, I hated
                them. But when I spent more time learning them on my own and understanding how they function, I thought, "THESE ARE AMAZING!"
                Heck! I'm building this portfolio solely using them right now!!! I am also a practicing Music Producer/Musician--who knows, I might
                use an API to put that playlist on here üòÅüòÅüòÅ

            <h2>Relationship with Tech</h2>
            <p>
                Like many Youngsters, I started my coding days in college--Rutgers University specifically. I took a couple courses, but
                they were too difficult for me to understand--I didn't stop taking them though. Next, I went onto a study abroad program in South
                Africa for web development where I landed my first internship. Again, the program I didn't understand, but the internship
                I did and was able to do well in it. Next came another web development bootcamp--Rutgers' bootcamp--but again I didn't understand
                the material, so I wasn't able to take away any content from it--INITIALLY! All of these inadequacies didn't sit right with me--the 
                mere fact that I couldn't understand what a server was was impeding my ability to imbibe knowledge in this field. So, I took
                some online courses and out of nowhere I started developing this understanding of technology. Everything started to make sense.
                What a server is, what Object-Oriented Programming is, how to understand APIs--all my past failures at attempts within this industry provided me with 
                a solid background because now I know what it is like to be on both spectrums of incompetence and ablility, and now I feel like a mature coder.
